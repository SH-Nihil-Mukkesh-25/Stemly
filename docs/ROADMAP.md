# Roadmap

Where Stemly is headed. This is a living document — community input is welcome!

## Current Status

Stemly v0.2.x is a working prototype with:
- Image scanning and AI topic detection
- Physics simulations (9 interactive templates)
- AI-generated study notes and quizzes
- Multi-provider AI tutor chat
- Firebase authentication with Google Sign-In
